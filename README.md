Raspberry Pi: Obviously, you’ll need a Raspberry Pi. MagicMirror supports the Raspberry Pi 2, 3, and 4, so you have quite a lot of options to choose from. Since MagicMirror has very modest hardware requirements, it doesn’t matter which version of the Raspberry Pi you choose. You can also run MagicMirror on Raspberry Pi Zero and Zero W, but their minimal nature somewhat complicates the installation process.
LCD screen: If you have an old monitor or laptop lying around, you’re in luck because you can reuse it for this project. With an old monitor, you simply need to remove the plastic frame (don’t touch any of the capacitors inside!), and you’re good to go. To use an LCD screen for an old laptop, you also need to get a matching controller board with an HDMI port. Just search the serial number of the screen on eBay, and you should be able to find the right one in no time.
Two-way mirror: To create the magic mirror illusion, you need to place a two-way mirror in front of the LCD screen so that only bright text and graphics will shine through. Many businesses will happily cut you a two-way mirror of any size, so just look for one online or in your city. Glass two-way mirrors look nicer, but they are considerably more fragile than acrylic two-way mirrors.
Frame: You wouldn’t want to just slap a two-way mirror in front of an LCD screen and call it a day. To make your Raspberry Pi smart mirror display-worthy, you need a pretty frame. If you’re handy and have basic woodworking tools, you should be able to create one in under an hour. We recommend you watch this YouTube video by Fix This Build That if you’re not sure how to start (just replace all the power tools with hand tools). Alternatively, you can purchase a suitable frame in the store.
Keyboard and mouse: To set up your Raspberry Pi and install MagicMirror, you’ll need a keyboard and mouse. Many Raspberry Pi users swear by the Logitech K400 Plus, which is a wireless keyboard with an integrated touchpad and multimedia keys that let you control your magic mirror remotely.
HDMI cable and power supply: Last but not least, you won’t be able to enjoy your Raspberry Pi smart mirror without a power supply (one for the Raspberry Pi and one for the LCD screen) and HDMI cable.
